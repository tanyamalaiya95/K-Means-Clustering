# K-Means-Clustering : European Employment Dataset
## Data
The data being used for clustering is the European Employment Dataset, which consists of the percentage employed in 10 different industries in 26 European countries during 1979. 
## Goal and Background
The objective of this analysis is to examine the data and get insight into patterns of employment (if any) amongst European countries in 1970s.
## Approach
Initially, exploratory data analysis is conducted. Next, 2 clustering methods are used for this analysis: K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering. For the first algorithm, outcomes from different number of clusters are observed and compared. Additionally, the different algorithms to assess the optimum number of clusters for this data are applied. For Hierarchical clustering algorithm, Wards method is used to create a clustering dendrogram. This is then cut back to 3 levels and the outcome is plotted.
## Major Findings
Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia are the most distinct countries in the subset of data analyzed. Agriculture, manufacturing, SPS, and SI are the variables with the largest variations across countries (in that order), so they are primary considering for splitting data into clusters. The optimum number of clusters for this data would be 9. Hierarchical clustering dendrogram further stratifies the hypothesis about the 3 aforementioned countries from the EDA.
